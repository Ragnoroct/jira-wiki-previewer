# Jira Wiki Previewer
## Description
This extension uses a jira api to render `jira wiki` syntax in a live preview.  

## NOTE: 
Since `jira wiki` will eventually be phased out, this extension was quickly made and it might be rough around the edges. It still works pretty well though.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `jira-wiki-previewer.jiraHostUrl`: **Required** The jira host url for your solution.  
  This will be hit by the api to render the output.
